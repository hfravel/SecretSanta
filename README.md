# SecretSanta
Secret Santa generator where you can restrict who each person can give to.
## basic
The basic package was my first attempt, and not much thought was put into it. 
The BasicSecretSantaGenerator does not work and I spent more time planning out how best to operate and store the people.
## hashed
The hashed package has my working Secret Santa Generator that allows you to restrict who each person can give to.
This makes use of HashMaps to store the people to allow ease of insertion, deletion, and find.
## website
The website package has a website where you can run the Secret Santa Generator. 
This has the same functionality as my hashed Secret Santa, but now you can use a website to initialize everything, instead of a command line.
